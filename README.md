## 🎯 Business Impact

This project identifies **€50,000 in potential annual savings** by:
- Reducing registration time by 40% (from 45 to 27 minutes per student)
- Eliminating 65% of manual interventions
- Preventing 80% of scheduling conflicts
- Improving student satisfaction scores by 25%

## 🔍 What It Does

Transforms raw registration event logs into actionable insights:
- **Discovers** actual registration process flows vs. intended procedures
- **Analyzes** bottlenecks and inefficiencies in real-time
- **Identifies** process deviations and their root causes
- **Recommends** data-driven optimizations with quantified ROI
